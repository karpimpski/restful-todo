**To Run**

In the root directory, enter the following commands:

`npm i`

`npm run start`

If you have any problems with Concurrently, try running `npm i concurrently --global`

If you have any problems with MongoDB, ensure that it is installed on your machine and included in your PATH. Test this by running `mongod --version` in a terminal.
